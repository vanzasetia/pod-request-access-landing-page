# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 22, 2022*

I am using [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/), which is simple, easy to use, self-hosted web analytics. Umami collects only the metrics I care about and everything fits on a single page, I have made my [analytics dashboard](https://umami-vanzasetia.herokuapp.com/share/EnyuqfqO/officialpod) public so that you can see exactly what is being gathered.

## Why do I collect that information?

**I use website analytics for strictly learning purposes.** I just want to try using it.

## How do I use the information that I collect?

**I am not going to sell or share your data with any third parties.**

However, you are going to play around with the `form`, I would recommend submitting a fake email address instead of your real email address to ensure your privacy.

## How about Cookies?

Umami may use Cookies on the end device of the User (e.g. computer, tablet, smartphone). Cookies are used to to improve the performance of the tracking script.

If you don't like the Cookies, you can delete all the Cookies. Information on how to delete Cookies in the most popular web browsers are included in the following links:

- [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835/pl)
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=pl)

## Third-party services

I use [Osano](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/) to create the cookie consent pop-up. It has its privacy and policy so you might want to visit [https://www.osano.com/legal/privacy](https://www.osano.com/legal/privacy) to learn more about it.

## Questions & Changes

I may update this policy as needed, like for example if I change the website analytics service, etc.

If you have any questions, feedback, or comments about this privacy policy, you could contact me through this email, venusbumi2@gmail.com. I'll be happy to answer them!
